| [[2024/Brendan ONeil\|Brendan ONeil]]      | This was the result of starting into PiPico from nothing to a 1st year putting into the classroom...                                                                           | The challenge of the concept was easy but having technology work in a limited time is always risky. From the CEMC at UofWaterloo & TopTechGuy.com (videos with incremental steps)... provided an incremental way as the teacher very quickly to create from nothing this project. Future goals of extending ideas are intended after the teacher become more familiar and comfortable. This CPT was done in a grade 10 class & was done in pairs to reduce first time challenges by group pair share learning.

We discuss how some steps must be in a particular order but others don't really matter (ie throwing out the garbage while the popcorn is popping vs after you have put the popcorn in a bowl).

Once all headlines are generated, the program writes the headlines to a file.

If the results of the algorithm mimic intelligence, that is only because of the humans responsible for designing, implementing, and training it. To that end, in ICS 4U1, we undertook to write a simple program that will LEARN to play Tic-tac-toe. The algorithm is not supplied with any foreknowledge of the game and becomes an "intelligent" player through experience alone. Included is Java source code for our implementation of this reinforcement learning based AI, along with some class notes posted to my classroom website and a PowerPoint presentation used to introduce the project. (The Java source code uses JavaFX to implement a user interface. The Game class and AI class do not depend on JavaFX, and a different user interface - e.g. text based - could be added) |

This is intended to follow a bouncing ball demo, to then be scaffolding for a catching game assignment. This lesson includes off-screen group discussions, and follows UDL principles by providing choice and level differentiation throughout the lesson. Running this lesson previously, students seemed to be especially engaged when they had a choice in how they complete this activity. Students work in groups to problem solve how to detect if a soccer ball following their cursor is within a soccer net, first on mini whiteboards, and then implement their solutions individually or in groups in Processing using the starter file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Students should have learned about object-oriented programming by the time they attempt this assignment. Before attempting this assignment, students will need an understanding of lists of objects. They need to be comfortable with the enhanced for loop. Regarding Greenfoot specifically they need a good grasp of getOneIntersectingObject(). Make sure there is at least one food object in the World. Otherwise, you will get a null pointer exception. They will probably need help coding the getDistance() method. The Math class has a Pythagorean method called Math.hypot() which would be very helpful for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
