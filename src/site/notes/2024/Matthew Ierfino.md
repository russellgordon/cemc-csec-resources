## Summary

ICD2O - Collision Detection

## Description

I've attached a zip file containing a Processing sketch, and a PDF document for an intro to collision detection lesson for ICD2O. This is intended to follow a bouncing ball demo, to then be scaffolding for a catching game assignment. This lesson includes off-screen group discussions, and follows UDL principles by providing choice and level differentiation throughout the lesson. Running this lesson previously, students seemed to be especially engaged when they had a choice in how they complete this activity. Students work in groups to problem solve how to detect if a soccer ball following their cursor is within a soccer net, first on mini whiteboards, and then implement their solutions individually or in groups in Processing using the starter file.
