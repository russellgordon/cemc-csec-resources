## Summary

ICS4U methods and error handling

## Description

This is an assignment that I've used in ICS4U as a way to review writing methods and error handling, and as a way for students to practice writing to file. The assignment has students write a Mad-Lib style program that generates click-bait headlines. Each headline type is generated using its own unique method. Once all headlines are generated, the program writes the headlines to a file. Included on the document is the instructions for students, some sample program output, required components, and a rubric for teachers to use to mark. It takes a simple premise - generate random data and print it to file - and puts a fun, relatable spin on it for students
