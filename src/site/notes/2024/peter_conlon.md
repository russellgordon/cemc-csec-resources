## Summary

Greenfoot - Two Animals Assignment - Lists of Objects

## Description

This is intended as an assignment for ICS4U1 using a java environment called Greenfoot. Students should have learned about object-oriented programming by the time they attempt this assignment. Before attempting this assignment, students will need an understanding of lists of objects. They need to be comfortable with the enhanced for loop. Regarding Greenfoot specifically they need a good grasp of getOneIntersectingObject(). Make sure there is at least one food object in the World. Otherwise, you will get a null pointer exception. They will probably need help coding the getDistance() method. The Math class has a Pythagorean method called Math.hypot() which would be very helpful for this.
